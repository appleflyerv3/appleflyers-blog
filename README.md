It's hugely inspired by me appleflyer because there is NO DOCUMENTATION and customizing this blog was hell.

- __Minimal, NO DOCUMENTATION, MENTAL BREAKDOWN READY__ always updated to Astro's latest (currently `2.x` release) under the hood.


## How to start?
*read all the code just to find one thing u want to change* 

**Note:** gives u headaches

Head over to `aalam.in/blog` and know
