# WARNING: THIS GUIDE HAS RISK INVOLVED INTO IT. IT MAY BRICK YOUR COMPUTER JUST LIKE HOW THE PENCIL BYPASS CAN. Any damages made is your own fault. Not mine, or others.
## For this, you will be needing to BUY SOME ITEMS which cost about 10-15 dollars max on Amazon. If you don't want to buy items to deprovision your device, I suggest going to the SH1MMER discord server instead to look for other methods.

Hello! If you are reading this, you probably are interested in flashing the chromebook's chip probably because you want to unenroll it (the main purpose of this guide). I have decided to make this document because I took a really long while just to gather some information on chip flashing and so I have decided to share what I have found as a guide. 
(personally i feel the pencil bypass is way riskier and requires a shim whereas this method doesn't require a shim and has less risk involved. nevertheless, it is still risky)

## Necessary Materials and Files
### Materials
First, you will need to buy a CH341a programmer that is basically a mini programmer that can read and program 24 and 24 series chips, as well as other microcontrollers, EEPROMs, and other memory chips. This is definitely a needed item in order to flash the chip. 

You will also need a clip to clip onto the chip so that you can connect the programmer to the chip. For some chips, you might also need to have an adaptor that you can mount onto the programmer so that the computer can read and write on the chip.
