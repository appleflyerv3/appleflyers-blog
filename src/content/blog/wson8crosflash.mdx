# WARNING: THIS GUIDE HAS RISK INVOLVED INTO IT. IT MAY BRICK YOUR COMPUTER JUST LIKE HOW THE PENCIL BYPASS CAN. Any damages made is your own fault. Not mine, or others.

Hello! If you are reading this, you probably are interested in flashing the chromebook's chip probably because you want to unenroll it (the main purpose of this guide). I have decided to make this document because I took a really long while just to gather some information on chip flashing and so I have decided to share what I have found as a guide. 

```bash
# make a new project directory and jump into it
mkdir my-astro-project && cd $_

# create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest

# or yarn
yarn create astro

# or pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest
```

## Python

```python
print('hello world')
```

## Javascript

```js
const func = () => {alert("hello")}
```
