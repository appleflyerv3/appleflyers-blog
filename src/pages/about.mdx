            **Astro-Ink** is a crisp, minimal, personal blog theme for Astro, that shows the capability of statically built sites - offering all the goodness and DX of the modern JS ecosystem without actually shipping any JS by default.

            **Astro-ink** strives to remain minimal & performant while still offering you all the bells and whistles you expect in a personal blog system. Please check the [README](https://github.com/one-aalam/astro-ink/blob/main/README.md) to know about all the features.
