Hello! This is the guide on how to use Ultiframe.
a "proxy" that kinda worksâ€¦??
(made by appleflyerv3)

# a. How to use UltiFrame
so if you have actually tried the website, you would have realised that a lot of the websites that you tried using doesnt work. why??

long story short,
you need an extension for it to work.

## ab. Installing Extensions
check if your chrome webstore is blocked.
go to https://chromewebstore.google.com and see if this website is blocked. 
if this website is blocked, go to part ac and don't come back here to part ab. if not, continue reading part ab and you dont have to do part ac.

if somehow, the chrome webstore is not blocked, well, you're lucky! install 
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/desktop-whatsa-online-mes/ehcanhoaekbglbenfcoeacjibmmllgjf>
and
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multi-chat-messenger-for/dllplfhjknghhdneiblmkolbjappecbe>

butt, if somehow installing the extensions are blocked, go to part c

## ac. Installing Extensions even when it's blocked
for this, you will need another computer which has google chrome and can download extensions :P
no second computer with google chrome? too bad. btw u cant just use ur friends chromebook. you need an unenrolled chromebook or at least a device that has the chrome web store unblocked.

open your second computer, and log in to the browser with your school google account

then install
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/desktop-whatsa-online-mes/ehcanhoaekbglbenfcoeacjibmmllgjf>
and
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multi-chat-messenger-for/dllplfhjknghhdneiblmkolbjappecbe>

now, the extensions should be installed on your school chromebook. if its not, too bad lol. you either did the steps wrong or it just doesnt work 4 u. too bad u cant do the exploit lol.


# b. using UltiFrame
now that you have successfully installed the extensions, you are able to use ultiframe.
turn on the two extensions and ultiframe should work
pages such as discord, telegram and others

sidenote: sometimes the extensions may turn off themselves because of the restrictions. you may need to turn them back on randomly


but whatsapp doesnt work
but what if you want whatsapp??

## ba. whatsapp with UltiFrame
whatsapp link to use whatsapp later on : https://web.whatsapp.com

ok so u want whatsapp huh. ok. if you had tried, it would give you an error.
but, we installed 2 extensions earlier. why not one? well one was for enabling websites, but one was for enabling WHATSAPP.

if you had gone to the whatsapp website on ultiframe, it would give this error:
![whatsapp image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appleflyerv3/appleflyers-blog/main/public/Screenshot%202024-04-20%2015.11.48.png "whatsapp image")
so how do we fix that? well on the top of this page, there should be 3 icons. a tools icon, a gear icon and an reload icon
![whatsapp image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appleflyerv3/appleflyers-blog/main/public/Screenshot%202024-04-20%2015.12.14.png "whatsapp image")
very simple. all you need to do is press the reload button on this page. BOOM DONE WHATSAPP LETS GO
